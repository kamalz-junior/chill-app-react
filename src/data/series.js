    "Ted Lasso, an optimistic American college football coach from Kansas, is unexpectedly hired to manage AFC Richmond, a struggling English Premier League soccer team. Despite his lack of soccer experience, Ted’s folksy charm, relentless positivity, and unconventional leadership begin to win over the skeptical team, its owner Rebecca Welton—who secretly hopes he’ll fail as revenge against her ex-husband—and the fans. Over the course of the season, Ted navigates cultural differences, personal challenges, and team dynamics to inspire change both on and off the pitch.",
